                                        Purpose: 
                                        The principal objective of AWS Landing Zone solution is to enable companies to have a multi-account AWS environment that complies with AWS’ recommended best practices. It is designed to automate the set up of canonical AWS accounts, configurations, and the basic elements that a multi-account system must have.

                                    <p>AWS Organizations: AWS Accounts management</p>
                                    <p>Account Vending Machine (AVM): Creates AWS accounts right-sized to a well-defined baseline of configurations and security</p>
                                    <p>AWS SSO integration: Centralized Identity Management and Access Control for AWS accounts</p>
                                    <p>Shared Services Account: Delivers resources needed for logging, network, security, among others</p>
                                    <p>Security baseline: Tools (AWS Config, CloudTrail, GuardDuty) needed to make all the accounts compliant with AWS security best practices</p>
                                    <p>Networking: Establishes a secure structure with Amazon VPC  </p>

                                            <p>Deployment process: 
                                                Initial setup: To start up the AWS Landing Zone implementation you start an AWS CloudFormation template. This template creates the core AWS accounts (Security, Shared Services).
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                Account creation: Employ the Account Vending Machine to create a new AWS account that has inherited the security and governance policies required in the Landing Zone framework. The deployment can be also personalized to suit requirements such as correcting security deficiencies, setting up your logging facility, or third-party security tool integrations.</p>

                                                method for keeping the same

                                                Salesforce is responsible for converting the older IT systems without
                                                disrupting the critical systems.
                                                CRM platforms are intended to help industry companies modernise their supply
                                                networks. Then,
                                                while maintaining the core of the businesses, agility is added to the
                                                complex processes.

                                                As the number of online businesses has grown in recent years, time
                                                management has become
                                                increasingly important in the logistics industry. Customers are unwilling to
                                                repeat orders from online
                                                businesses that provide a poor logistical experience. The Salesforce
                                                implementation service aims to
                                                assist logistics and transportation companies in managing all records from a
                                                single dashboard.
                                                As a result, keeping track of the lead timing will be much easier. It gives
                                                all businesses the ability to
                                                manage their orders and delivery times. All deliveries can now be managed
                                                efficiently through a
                                                single point with this process.
