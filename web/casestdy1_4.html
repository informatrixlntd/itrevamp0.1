                                </h2><hr>

                                <p>The client is a rapidly growing digital wallet startup that provides an innovative platform for secure payments, peer-to-peer transfers, and in-store purchases. With a user base spanning multiple regions, the company has experienced exponential growth over the past two years. As a disruptor in the financial technology space, the startup aims to offer fast, reliable, and cost-effective solutions to consumers and businesses alike. As the user base expanded, the company began facing infrastructure challenges, including frequent service disruptions, slow transaction processing times, and difficulties scaling to meet peak demand. The startup needed a flexible and reliable infrastructure that could support its rapid growth while ensuring system availability and performance.</p><br>

                                <h2>Challenge:</h2><hr>
                                <p>The company’s infrastructure, originally designed for smaller-scale operations, began to struggle with the surge in user activity and transaction volume. The challenges included:</p>


                                <ul>
                                    <li>

                                        <p><b>System Overload During Peak Hours:</b> The infrastructure couldn’t handle peak transaction volumes, leading to slow processing times, system slowdowns, and occasional downtime during high-demand periods such as holidays or promotions.</p>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>

                                        <p><b>Lack of Scalability:</b> The existing infrastructure was not designed to scale efficiently, resulting in difficulties adjusting to fluctuating traffic demands. During periods of rapid growth, the startup could not provision additional resources quickly enough.</p>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>

                                        <p><b>Manual Resource Management:</b> Infrastructure management was done manually, which was time-consuming and prone to errors. This made it difficult to keep up with the increasing demand for resources.</p>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>

                                        <p><b>Inadequate Fault Tolerance:</b> The startup’s infrastructure lacked redundancy, making it vulnerable to outages. This was a critical concern, as downtime could lead to lost revenue, customer dissatisfaction, and damage to brand reputation.</p>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>

                                        <p><b>High Operational Costs:</b> The startup's on-premise infrastructure was expensive to maintain, and resource underutilization during off-peak hours led to high operational costs.</p>
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>The company needed a scalable infrastructure solution that would allow them to handle high volumes of transactions, scale dynamically based on demand, reduce downtime, and minimize costs.</p>
