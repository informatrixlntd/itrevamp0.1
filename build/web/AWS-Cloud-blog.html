                                        Many modern operating systems rely on full automation to eliminate manual

                                        to production environments, software releases, machine configuration, operating

                                        troubleshooting, and bug fixes. Many different levels of automation can be combined
                                        to create a
                                        higher-level end-to-end automated process.

                                            <h5>Low-code development is becoming more popular</h5>

                                                Clients use a low-code strategy to build customer-facing web apps, data

                                                workflow processes, and automation use cases to speed up digital
                                                transformation efforts in 2024.
                                                This low-code platform lets IT professionals spend less time on trivial use
                                                cases and extra time on
                                                business-critical and sophisticated use cases.

                                                Several businesses have turned to low-code in pandemic conditions to swiftly
                                                design and deploy
                                                applications. The switch to low-code software is expected to achieve
                                                substantial attention by 2024.
                                                Low-code is designed to cover the full software development cycle as it
                                                becomes more popular.
